The provided code implements a generic queue data structure using a linked list approach, specifically tailored for handling objects of any type that implements the Comparable interface. The Queue class offers standard queue operations such as adding, polling, peeking, checking if empty, getting the size, and checking for containment. The theme of games is incorporated through the Game class, which represents a game with a name and price, and implements the Comparable interface to allow for price-based comparisons. This class is used to demonstrate the functionality of the queue, allowing games to be added, removed, and managed within the queue structure.
